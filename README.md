Final project for my Bachelor in *Electronic and Communications Engineering*

:school: School: *Politecnico di Torino*

:date: Date: Jan 2018

:page_facing_up: Report: [`latex/SAS2017_18_senacheribbe.pdf`](latex/SAS2017_18_senacheribbe.pdf)

## Description

The project consists of the following tasks:

- **Task 1**: analysis of filtered periodic signals

- **Task 2**: implementation of discrete-time low-pass Butterworth filter

- **Task 3**: filtering white Gaussian noise with discrete-time LTI filter

The code is written in MATLAB and it generates the plots and figures for the report.

The report is written using latex and it's available here: [`latex/SAS2017_18_senacheribbe.pdf`](latex/SAS2017_18_senacheribbe.pdf)
